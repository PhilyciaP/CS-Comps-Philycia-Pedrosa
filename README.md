# Predicting Batting Average and Pitching ERA Using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict **batting average (BA)** and **earned run average (ERA)** for baseball players based on historical performance data. The analysis is conducted using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, pybaseball, etc.
